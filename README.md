## 🚀 Telescope Rotation Mount
**SolidWorks | Assemblies | Mates | Exploded Views**  
Designed the central rotation mechanism for a 3-leg telescope stand.  
Includes full assembly, parametric features, exploded view, and engineering drawings.

➡️ *Project Folder Coming Soon*

## 🧱 Beam Deflection Analysis (FEA + Analytical Comparison)
**SolidWorks Simulation | Material Analysis | Beam Theory**  
Modeled a 100 mm rectangular beam (7 × 18 mm, E = 210 GPa) and compared displacement and stress values with Euler-Bernoulli calculations.
